# Deployment Attempt Log

- `npm install` fails because the environment's proxy at `http://proxy:8080` returns HTTP 403 for npm registry requests, while disabling the proxy produces `ENETUNREACH` errors preventing any downloads.
- Without installed dependencies, `npm run build` fails (`next: not found`).
- Installing the Vercel CLI via `npm install -g vercel` also cannot proceed because it cannot reach the registry.
- Consequently, `vercel --prod` is unavailable for deployment.
- Commands attempted:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm_config_progress=false npm install --loglevel=info`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm_config_progress=false npm install -g vercel`
  - `vercel --prod`
