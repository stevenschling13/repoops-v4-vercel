# Privacy Policy – RepoOps Engineer GPT
**Owner:** Steven Schlingman (stevenschlingman62@gmail.com)  
**Effective:** 2025-10-06

This GPT can call external APIs (GitHub, Vercel) using tokens you provide.  
We do **not** sell data.

## What is processed
- Prompts and messages you enter.
- Repo metadata and file contents needed to complete requested tasks.
- Action results/logs from GitHub and Vercel.

## Storage & retention
- The GPT does not persist repo contents or logs outside the chat/session.
- API tokens are stored by OpenAI as **Action secrets** and sent only to the target API.
- You can delete conversations at any time from ChatGPT.

## Sharing
- Data is sent only to the services you invoke (e.g., GitHub/Vercel) and OpenAI to run the GPT.

## Security
- Use least-privilege tokens where possible. Revoke tokens anytime in GitHub/Vercel.
- No production secrets should be pasted into chat.

## Your choices
- Don’t use the Actions if you don’t want data sent to third-party APIs.
- Revoke access by removing the GPT or deleting the Action secrets.
