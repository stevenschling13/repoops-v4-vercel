# RepoOps V4 – Vercel Ready Starter

A minimal-yet-opinionated Next.js 14 starter wired for Vercel deployments. It ships with the App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and linting defaults so you can bootstrap new projects quickly.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to confirm the landing page renders.

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the local development server.
- `npm run build` – create an optimized production build.
- `npm run start` – serve the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint using the Next.js config.

## Deployment

The configuration is tuned for Vercel. Push the repository to GitHub and import it into Vercel to provision preview deployments automatically. When you are ready, promote a preview to production or trigger a `vercel --prod` deployment.
